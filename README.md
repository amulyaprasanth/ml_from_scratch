# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms — From Scratch & Using Libraries

This repository contains implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms, both:
- ✅ **From Scratch** (with Python/NumPy)
- ⚙️ **Using scikit-learn and other libraries**

It is inspired by my journey through the legendary [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) course by [Prof. Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) at Stanford University.
